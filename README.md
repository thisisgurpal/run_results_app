# General Assembly Project 4 - RunnersUniverse
This was a solo project where I created a running app that allows visitors to get information on running events, view past years leaders, view runners profiles, view fitness and health blogs and once registered and logged in you can favourite runners, favourite blogs and also comment on running events. For this project I built the back end which included making my own API, I also designed and developed the front end. This was done using PostgreSQL, Python, TablePlus, React. You can find this application <a href="https://runnersuniverse.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.
